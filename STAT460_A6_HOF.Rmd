# Question
Using the same data you recieved for the final project and assuming $\siga^2 = 1$, implement the Bayesian Lasso described in the article *The Bayesian Lasso* by Park and Casella to sample from the joint posterior of $(\beta_, \ta_1^2, \ldots, tau_p^2)$. Carefully write down the model and the full conditionals. You don't need to provide a detailed derivation of the full conditionals.

## Part 1
The full conditional of $\beta$ is


We first read in the data.

```{r data, include=FALSE}
dat = readMat("Dataset_FinalProject_2.mat")
X = dat$X
y = dat$Y
```
